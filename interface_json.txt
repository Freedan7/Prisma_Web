/*These are the table names and the elements / values that I would like stored in them,
formatted as follows:

table-name [
	label: 	outcome,
	label: 	outcome
]
	
I would like for the values for each element in the two tables to be set by default to 
a NULL integer. The values will be populated when the doctor submits his or her input
from the surgery risk interface.
